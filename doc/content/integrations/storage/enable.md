summary: Enable Storage Integration for applications and end-devices.
weight: 20
---

The Storage Integration is implemented as an [Application Package]({{< ref "/reference/application-packages" >}}). In order to enable it for an application (or a single end device), you have to create a package association.

{{< cli-only >}}

{{< warning >}}The Storage Integration is new in {{% tts %}} 3.10. You may need to update the CLI to use the new features. See instructions in [Installing the CLI]({{< ref "/getting-started/cli/installing-cli" >}})
{{</ warning >}}

## Enable for an Application

Set up a default association between the desired application and the `storage-integration` package.

```bash
$ ttn-lw-cli applications packages default-associations set "app1" 100 --package-name storage-integration
```

{{< note >}} The `f_port` for the default association is set to `100`. This value is irrelevant. **The storage integration will receive and store all uplink messages, regardless of `f_port`**. The `f_port` value is only needed because of the way application packages work with {{% tts %}}. {{</ note >}}

{{< warning >}} **Do not configure more than one default association for the same application**, since that will lead to storing duplicate messages in the persistent storage. {{</ warning >}}

## Enable for an End Device

Set up an association between the desired end device and the `storage-integration` package.

```bash
$ ttn-lw-cli applications packages associations set "app1" "dev1" 100 --package-name storage-integration
```

{{< note >}} The `f_port` value is irrelevant. {{</ note >}}

{{< warning >}} **Do not configure multiple associations for the same end device**, since that will lead to storing duplicate uplinks in the persistent storage. {{</ warning >}}

## Disable the Storage Integration

Delete the package association, or the default association:

```bash
# List default associations
$ ttn-lw-cli applications packages default-associations list "app1"
{
  "defaults": [
    {
      "ids": {
        "application_ids": {
          "application_id": "app1"
        },
        "f_port": 100
      },
      "created_at": "2020-08-24T21:09:44.649890166Z",
      "updated_at": "2020-08-24T21:09:44.649890166Z",
      "package_name": "storage-integration"
    }
  ]
}
```

```bash
$ ttn-lw-cli applications packages default-associations delete "app1" 100
```
